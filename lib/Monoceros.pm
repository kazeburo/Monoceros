=head1 NAME

Monoceros - PSGI/Plack server with event driven connection manager, preforking workers

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    % plackup -s Monoceros --max-keepalive-reqs=10000 --max-workers=2 -a app.psgi

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Monoceros is PSGI/Plack server supports HTTP/1.1. Monoceros has a event-driven 
connection manager and preforking workers. Monoceros can keep large amount of 
connection at minimal processes.

Features of Monoceros

- a manager process based on L<AnyEvent> keeps over C10K connections

- uses L<IO::FDPass> for passing a file descriptor to workers

- supports HTTP/1.1 and also supports HTTP/1.0 keepalive

And this server inherit L<Starlet>. Monoceros supports following features too.

- prefork and graceful shutdown using L<Parallel::Prefork>

- hot deploy using L<Server::Starter>

- fast HTTP processing using L<HTTP::Parser::XS> (optional)

- accept4(2) using L<Linux::Socket::Accept4> (optional)

Currently, Monoceros does not support spawn-interval and max-keepalive-reqs.

=head1 COMMAND LINE OPTIONS

In addition to the options supported by L<plackup>, Monoceros accepts following options(s).
Note, the default value of several options is different from Starlet.

=head2 --max-workers=#

number of worker processes (default: 5)

=head2 --timeout=#

seconds until timeout (default: 300)

=head2 --keepalive-timeout=#

timeout for persistent connections (default: 10)

=head2 --max-reqs-per-child=#

max. number of requests to be handled before a worker process exits (default: 1000)

=head2 --min-reqs-per-child=#

if set, randomizes the number of requests handled by a single worker process between the value and that supplied by C<--max-reqs-per-chlid> (default: none)

=head2 --max-keepalive-connection=#

max, number of connections to keep in the manager process. If you want to increase this value, You should check your system limitations. (default: half number of POSIX::_SC_OPEN_MAX)

=head2 --max-readahead-reqs=#

max. number of requests to continue to read a request in a worker process. Monoceros can read a next request after the response for maximum throughput. (default: 100)

=head2 --min-readahead-reqs=#

if set, randomizes the number of requests to continue to read a request between the value and that supplied by C<--max-readahead-reqs> (default: none)

=head2 --disable-keepalive

disable HTTP keepalive feature (default: enabled)

=head1 RECOMMENDED MODULES

For more performance. I recommends you to install these module.

- L<EV>

- L<HTTP::Parser::XS>

=head1 EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES

=over 4

=item accept4

Linux only. If Linux::Socket::Accept4 is available, Monoceros use it.
accept4(2) can do accept(2) and set SOCK_CLOEXEC|SOCK_NONBLOCK at once. 

=item sendfile

Monoceros send IO::Handle like body with sendfile(2). L<Sys::Sendfile> is required.
